Measures temperature using w1 sensor DS18B20
Requires the following packages:
RPi.GPIO
thingspeak

In order to use w1 sensor you need add
dtoverlay=w1-gpio in /boot/config.txt

Logfile is /var/log/greenhouse/temperature.log
So, such folder must be created and permissions must be given for
the user. For example
sudo mkdir /var/log/greenhouse
sudo chown pi:pi /var/log/greenhouse

This script is controlled by cron (for user pi), there should be a backup of
the crontab in this folder. See Exploring Pi chaper 12. In order to use
environmental variables, put those in /etc/environment
Example crontab -l
# m h  dom mon dow   command
*/10 * * * * <app path> 2>&1

Sensitive information, pwd, etc stored in /etc/environment. This file
is read by cron (and also Pycharm).
Example
export PWD="\"<pwd with special characters>\""

In order to use w1 you need:
dtoverlay=w1-gpio in /boot/config.txt or for older linux
sudo modprobe w1-gpio && sudo modprobe w1_therm
w1 data:
ls -l /sys/bus/w1/devices/
cat /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-000007a6f1c4/w1_slave
